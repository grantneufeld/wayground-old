Notes for developers (coders) working on the Wayground code.

These are things to do while working on the code.


GENERAL EDITING

• All files should be saved in utf-8 format.
• Please use tabs, not spaces, to indent lines in the code.

• Use the standard tags at the beginning when adding working comments: TODO, FIXME, OPTIMIZE. These allow use of the `rake notes` tasks (`rake notes:fixme`, etc.). E.g., “# TODO need to make an example comment here”


TESTING

Please follow test-driven development (TDD) — write your tests before you write your code!
See the Peepcode Screencast for a tutorial on this approach: http://peepcode.com/products/test-first-development

For unit tests:
• Use the check_associations method (found in test/test_helper.rb). See existing unit tests for examples.

For functional tests:
• Test routing for the controller with the assert_routing_for_resource method (test/test_helper.rb), and the assert_generates and assert_recognizes methods. See the existing controller tests for examples.

• use test+*@wayground.ca for email addresses in test cases (where ‘*’ is some phrase relevant to the tests you are using the address in).


EMAIL

• Mailer classes inherit from ActionMailer::ARMailer (not ActionMailer::Base).


VERSION CONTROL

To save changes to the repository:
(from the project directory root)
 git add .
 git commit -m "short message about what is being committed"

If you don’t want to commit all changes, use:
 git add path/to/files/to/commit
instead of `git add .`

To update the GitHub repository (if you’ve setup the correct access for this):
 git push origin master
