• Surveys: Links to candidate’s responses to surveys.

An interesting wireframe idea for a user-centred government site:

REGISTERED USER FUNCTIONS

Allow users to pick which wards/ridings/eds/etc. they are in manually, or by entering a postal code, or a street address.
Specify which school board, neither or both.
Allow users to add non governmental institutions that have elected representatives (co-ops, credit unions, etc.).

MAPPING

Have a database that maps ward/riding/etc. overlaps, and can identify which ward/riding/etc.(s) a given postal code or address falls in.
